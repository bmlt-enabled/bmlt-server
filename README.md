DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-scheduled, weekly, recurring events.

The original intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies, though it has since been adopted by other 12-step 
fellowships as well. Service bodies deploy BMLT servers to manage meeting information and share access with other NA 
Service bodies throughout their region. This repository contains the server component of BMLT's client/server 
architecture.

You can find out more about the BMLT on the [website](https://bmlt.app).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The server requires a MySQL 5.7 database or higher and PHP 8.2 or higher.In addition, the following PHP modules
are required: `curl gd intl mbstring mysql xml zip`. In particular, make sure you have `intl` -- this one is more
likely to be missing. There are a variety of MySQL modules for PHP, and others will probably work as a substitute
for `mysql` itself.

For more information about server requirements, see the "Things You Will Need Before You Install" section of
[Installing a New Server](https://bmlt.app/setting-up-the-bmlt/).

INSTALLATION
------------

For instructions on installing the server, see [installation/README.md](installation/README.md).

DEVELOPMENT
------------

For specific information on setting up a development environment for work on the BMLT server, please
